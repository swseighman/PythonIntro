### Python Basics

### Constants
A constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a program. Python doesnâ€™t have built-in constant types, but Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed:
```
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000
```

When you want to treat a variable as a constant in your code, write the name of the variable in all capital letters.
